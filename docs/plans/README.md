# Plans Directory (Temporary)

This directory contains **work-in-progress planning documents** used during feature development.

## Purpose

We're experimenting with different planning and execution practices to find what works best for AI-assisted development. Plans here are:

- ✅ Living documents that evolve during implementation
- ✅ Used to coordinate between human and AI agents
- ✅ Experiments in planning granularity and structure
- ❌ Not final documentation (see blog posts instead)
- ❌ Not committed to git (`.gitignore`d)

## Lifecycle

1. **Create plan** before major feature (e.g., `maestro-autonomous-execution-plan.md`)
2. **Iterate** during implementation (may diverge from original)
3. **Document lessons** in `lessons-learned.md`
4. **Distill** into blog post when feature is complete
5. **Archive or delete** plan after blog post is published

## Current Experiments

- **Maestro (Autonomous Execution)**: Testing detailed upfront planning with code examples and task breakdowns
- **Tracking**: What worked vs what didn't, velocity, rewrite rate

## Future Blog Posts

Lessons learned here will be synthesized into:
- "Effective Practices for AI-Assisted Development"
- "Building Chuchu Maestro: A Case Study"
- "When to Plan vs When to Iterate"

## Notes

If you find this directory in the repo, it means we're actively building something and haven't published the final learnings yet. Check back in `docs/_posts/` for polished documentation.
