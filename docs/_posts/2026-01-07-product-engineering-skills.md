## The Problem With "AI Coding Assistants"

Every AI coding tool promises the same thing: **"Write code faster."**

And they deliver. Sort of.

You ask for a login form, you get a login form. You ask for an API endpoint, you get an API endpoint. The code compiles. The tests pass.

**But is it production-ready?**

- Does it have proper tracking pixels?
- Does it follow your design system?
- Are there health checks?
- What about error boundaries?
- Feature flags for safe rollout?
- Accessibility attributes?

**Usually not.**

Because AI coding assistants are trained to write **code**, not to ship **products**.

## From Code Assistant to Product Engineering Assistant

Here's the insight that changes everything:

> **Great engineering isn't about writing code. It's about shipping products that work.**

A senior engineer doesn't just implement features. They:

1. **Follow design system patterns** (not reinvent UI components)
2. **Add tracking from day one** (not retrofit analytics later)
3. **Build in observability** (not debug in production)
4. **Consider accessibility** (not fail audits)
5. **Use feature flags** (not deploy and pray)

What if your AI assistant thought the same way?

## Introducing Product Skills

GPTCode's **Skills** are prompt injections that encode best practices beyond syntax. They're not just "write Go code" — they're "write Go code that handles errors properly, uses context for cancellation, and follows interface segregation."

And now, we have **Product Skills**:

### Design System Skill

When you're building UI, the AI doesn't just create a button:

```tsx
// Without skill: Whatever works
<button style={{background: 'blue', padding: '10px'}}>Submit</button>

// With design-system skill: Atomic design + tokens
<Button variant="primary" size="md">Submit</Button>
```

The skill teaches:
- **Atomic Design** (atoms → molecules → organisms)
- **Design tokens** (semantic color names, spacing scale)
- **Component API patterns** (composition over configuration)
- **Storybook documentation**
- **ARIA accessibility**

### Product Metrics Skill

Every feature needs tracking. The AI now knows:

```javascript
// Without skill: No tracking
handleSubmit(data);

// With product-metrics skill: Full attribution
analytics.track('form_submitted', {
  form_name: 'checkout',
  ...getUTMContext(),
  ...getUserContext(),
});
handleSubmit(data);
```

The skill covers:
- **Event naming conventions** (object_action pattern)
- **UTM parameter handling**
- **Conversion funnel tracking**
- **Core Web Vitals monitoring**
- **Privacy-compliant analytics**

### Production Ready Skill

Features ship with guardrails:

```tsx
// Without skill: Crashes on error
<UserProfile userId={id} />

// With production-ready skill: Graceful degradation
<ErrorBoundary fallback={<ProfileSkeleton />}>
  <Suspense fallback={<ProfileLoading />}>
    <UserProfile userId={id} />
  </Suspense>
</ErrorBoundary>
```

The skill includes:
- **Error boundaries** (React, Vue patterns)
- **Feature flags** (gradual rollouts)
- **Health checks** (readiness/liveness probes)
- **Circuit breakers** (graceful degradation)
- **Structured logging** (observability)

### QA Automation Skill

Tests aren't an afterthought:

```typescript
// Without skill: Fragile selectors
await page.click('.btn.btn-primary');

// With qa-automation skill: Stable, accessible
await page.click('[data-testid="submit-order"]');
await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot('checkout-complete.png');
await new AxeBuilder({ page }).analyze();
```

The skill teaches:
- **Page Object Model** (maintainable E2E)
- **Visual regression** (catch UI breaks)
- **Accessibility testing** (axe-core integration)
- **Performance budgets** (Lighthouse CI)

## The Compound Effect

Here's where it gets interesting.

Each skill alone improves code quality. **Together, they compound.**

When you ask `gt do "add checkout flow"`, the AI:

1. **Analyzes** your codebase (finds existing components)
2. **Plans** with all skills loaded (design system + metrics + production + QA)
3. **Generates** code that:
   - Uses your existing Button, Input, Card components
   - Includes form_submitted, purchase_completed events
   - Wraps in ErrorBoundary with fallback
   - Has data-testid on interactive elements
4. **Validates** that tests pass

**One command. Production-ready feature.**

## Why This Matters

### Junior → Senior Encoding

Every skill encodes patterns that take years to learn:

| Skill | Years of Experience Encoded |
|-------|----------------------------|
| TDD Bug Fix | "Always write the failing test first" |
| Design System | "Components should be composable" |
| Product Metrics | "Track everything from day one" |
| Production Ready | "Expect failures, handle gracefully" |
| Code Review | "Focus on architecture, not syntax" |

Your AI assistant now has 10+ years of "senior engineering intuition."

### Team Consistency

When everyone's AI uses the same skills:
- Components look the same
- Events follow the same naming
- Error handling is consistent
- Tests use the same patterns

**No more "I didn't know we have a Button component."**

### Quality By Default

Instead of catching issues in code review:
- Design system violations → prevented
- Missing tracking → impossible
- No error handling → doesn't ship
- Inaccessible UI → flagged

**Shift left, all the way to generation.**

## How To Use Skills

### Built-in with GPTCode

```bash
# Skills are automatically injected based on project language
gt do "add user profile page"
# → Uses: TypeScript skill + Design System skill + Product Metrics skill
```

### Export to Other Tools

```bash
# Export for Cursor
gt skills show design-system > .cursorrules

# Export for VS Code Copilot
gt skills show production-ready > .github/copilot-instructions.md

# Export for Claude/Gemini
gt skills show product-metrics  # Copy to system prompt
```

### Create Custom Skills

```bash
# Your company's conventions
vi ~/.gptcode/skills/our-company.md

---
name: our-company-style
language: typescript
description: Our internal conventions
---

# Company Conventions

## All API calls must...
## All components must...
```

## The 15 Skills Available Today

### Language-Specific
- Go, Ruby, Rails, Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, Elixir, Rust

### Workflow
- TDD Bug Fix, Code Review, Git Commit

### Product Engineering (NEW)
- **Design System** — Atomic design, tokens, Storybook
- **Product Metrics** — GA4, UTM, funnels, pixels
- **Production Ready** — Error handling, feature flags, health checks
- **QA Automation** — E2E, visual regression, accessibility

## The Shift

AI coding assistants write code.

**Product Engineering Assistants ship products.**

The difference isn't the underlying model. It's the **skills** — the accumulated wisdom of senior engineers, encoded and injected into every prompt.

When your AI knows what "production-ready" means, it delivers production-ready code.
